# Java SE Data Persistence 
## Data Persistence 
Persistence denotes a process or an object that continues to exist even after its parent process or object ceases, or the system that runs it is turned off. When a created process needs persistence, non-volatile storage, including a hard disk, is used instead of volatile memory like RAM.

## Persistence in Databases
Persistent data is stable and retrievable. Traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS) store persistent data in the form of records and tables.
some relational databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.

An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style. For this reason, REST APIs are sometimes referred to RESTful APIs.
## How REST APIs work
REST APIs communicate via HTTP requests to perform standard database functions like creating, reading, updating, and deleting records (also known as CRUD) within a resource. For example, a REST API would use a GET request to retrieve a record, a POST request to create one, a PUT request to update a record, and a DELETE request to delete one. All HTTP methods can be used in API calls. This information can be delivered to a client in virtually any format including JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), HTML, XLT, Python, PHP, or plain text. JSON is popular because itâ€™s readable by both humans and machines
