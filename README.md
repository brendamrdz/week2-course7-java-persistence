# Java SE Data Persistence 
## Data Persistence 
Persistence denotes a process or an object that continues to exist even after its parent process or object ceases, or the system that runs it is turned off. When a created process needs persistence, non-volatile storage, including a hard disk, is used instead of volatile memory like RAM.

## Persistence in Databases

Persistent data is stable and retrievable. Traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS) store persistent data in the form of records and tables.
some relational databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.
